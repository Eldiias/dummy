# Code Etiquette and Debugging

Writing a code is a useful skill once obtained and never lost. And more you code, better your skills are. But is it always a case?

Every additional line of code can make you train your skills. But it doesn't mean you are actually learning something new. So, even after 10 years of coding, you might still be on the baseline. What does actually define your growth as programmist? Only ***your** code* represents you. And if you don't follow **code etiquette**, you will not be appriciated.

But first we will start with sove advices:

## 8 rules 

1. **Computer is never wrong**. Whenever you obtain an unsolveable error, take a break. "To take or not to take" - your computer knows better. 
2. **Calm down**. Emotions are bad. Obviously, it is difficult to concentrate on the code especially if it wasn't written by you. Calm down, think of it as a challenge. Take the challenge and be sure we believe in you.
3. **Just start**. No matter from which part of the task. No matter if it is a pseudocode generation or functional programming. Just start. You will never notice the moment when code is half-finished.
4. **Big Brother watches you**. You are creating a product (yeah, you will be paid for every line you write). Keep that in mind. Someone will read it after you. Make it as readable as possible. 
5. **Read books**. It is difficult to read books when your day is full of work/classes/whatever. But you need to grow as a personality, not onlyas a  professional. The main benefit of book reading is your ability to concentrate, imagine and discuss. 
6. **Know the tool you use**. *"I will never use it again"* is not an excuse to skip the documentation. Your code is automized as much as good you know the tool you use.
7. **No one is perfect**. If you spend most of your time trying to make your code perfect, you end up with no code. Try to keep is simple stupid on the develop step. And only when you make everything work, start optimizing and simplifying your code.
8. **Enjoy your free time**. If you think of the code all day long, you will dream of it as well. One can say it is good, but it is followed by overwork and exhausted brain. Exhausted brain can't solve problems. Have a hobby, go to gym, enjoy your life.
